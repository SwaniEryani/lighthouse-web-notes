### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.
```
const whatToDoForLunch = function(hungry, availableTime) {
  if (hungry) {
    if (availableTime < 20) {
      console.log("pick something up and eat it in the lab.");
    } if (availableTime >= 20 && availableTime <= 30) {
      console.log("try a place nearby :)");
    } if (availableTime > 30) {
      console.log("reminder: you should consider your time and get back to work ASAP ");
    }

  } else {
    console.log("get back to work :) ");
  }
};


/*
 * This is some test runner code that's simply calling our whatToDoForLunch function
 * defined above to verify we're making the right decisions. Do not modify it!
 */

console.log("I'm hungry and I have 20 minutes for lunch.");
whatToDoForLunch(true, 20);
console.log("---");

console.log("I'm hungry and I have 50 minutes for lunch.");
whatToDoForLunch(true, 50);
console.log("---");

console.log("I'm not hungry and I have 30 minutes for lunch.");
whatToDoForLunch(false, 30);
console.log("---");

console.log("I'm hungry and I have 15 minutes for lunch.");
whatToDoForLunch(true, 15);
```
